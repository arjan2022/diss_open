  abstract = {Coined in the early 1990s to describe a burgeoning film movement, 'New Queer Cinema' has turned the attention of film theorists, students and audiences to the proliferation of intelligent, stylish and daring work by lesbian and gay filmmakers within independent cinema, and to the proliferation of 'queer' images and themes within the mainstream. But what constituted New Queer Cinema then and now? And was it political gains, cultural momentum or market forces that determined its evolution? New Queer Cinema is divided into sections on the definition, the filmmakers, the geography, and the spectator of New Queer Cinema. Chapters address the pivotal directors (e.g. Todd Haynes and Gregg Araki) and the salient films (e.g. Paris is Burning and Boys Don't Cry) but also non-mainstream and non-Anglo-American work (e.g. experimental film and third cinema). With a critical eye to its uneasy relationship to the mainstream, the volume explores the aesthetic, socio-cultural, political and, necessarily, commercial investments of New Queer Cinema. This book, the first full-length study of the subject, offers the definitive guide to New Queer Cinema combining indispensable discussions of its central issues with exciting new work by key writers. Features*Provides a definitive introduction to New Queer Cinema (NQC)*Clear structure with each section addressing a key topic in the study of NQC*Themes covered include genre, gender and race, politics, media, and the relationship between NQC and the mainstream.},

During 1990-1995, 1995-2000 and 2000-2005, 2005-2010 periods there are 197 countries, where the old three letter alpha numeric codes for Serbia and Montenegro (SCG) and Sudan (SUD) are used. The combination of these countries follows their representation in United Nations migrant stock data. In periods after 2005-2010 there are 200 countries, where Serbia, Montenegro, Sudan and South Sudan are separate (as in the paper and previous versions) and estimates for Curaçao are also feasible.

Albania is known as one of the most extreme cases of self-reliance, and the author analyses information on the Albanian economic development in the post-war period in order to examine whether this reputation is a fact or a myth. The conclusion is that self-reliance in the full sense of the word has not been the road to develop ment in Albania due to aid and assistance from other socialist countries, especially China. Nevertheless, Albania today provides a unique example in achieving to a great extent its goal of self-reliance.},

The results indicate that the network changed significantly over this 20-year period. While the United States and some Western developed countries have remained at the center of the network, Asian and Middle Eastern countries have become more central and African countries have become more peripheral. The role of colonial and linguistic factors has become less important, while economic development has a more important role in international student exchanges. The international student exchange network suggests an academic hegemony consistent with that of economics and politics. The changes of the network reflect the hierarchical structure of the hegemonic powers in the modern world system.}

Mapping Desire presents the rich and diverse world of contemporary sexuality, exploring how the heterosexual body has been appropriated and resisted on the individual, community and city scales. The geographies presented here range across Europe, America, Australasia, Africa, the Pacific and the imaginary, cutting across city and country and analysing the positions of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and heterosexuals. The contributors ring different interests and approaches to bear on theoretical and empirical material from a wide range of sources. The book is divided into four sections: cartographies/identities; sexualised spaces: global/local; sexualised spaces: local/global; sites of resistance. Each section is separately introduced. Beyond the bibliography, an annotated guide to further reading is also provided to help the reader map their own way through the literature.},

  abstract = {International friendship affects the making and conduct of foreign policy, an angle that is largely neglected in the International Relations (IR) literature. Friendship constitutes the Other as familiar rather than foreign and implies a significant degree of trust, and analysts need to pay careful attention to the various ways close bonds develop and “work” across state boundaries. They need to understand how seeking friends can be an explicit goal of foreign policy and how established friendships function by studying their discursive, emotional, and practical expressions and their impact on decision making in concrete situations and as a disposition for cooperation in the long term. Yet, tracing these bonds and associated practices, especially the informal ones, is an analytical challenge. This article presents international friendship as a particular relationship of mutually agreed role identities embedded in a strong cognitive, normative, and emotional bond revolving around a shared idea of order. It discusses three types of practices unique to this relationship: providing privileged/special access, solidarity and support in times of need, and resolve and negative Othering against third parties. These friendship bonds and associated practices can be observed across three levels: political leaders, government bureaucracies, and civil society.},

By now he has. "Berger has the ability to cut right through the mystification of the professional art critics . . . He is a liberator of images: and once we have allowed the paintings to work on us directly, we are in a much better position to make a meaningful evaluation" —Peter Fuller, Arts Review "The influence of the series and the book . . . was enormous . . .

  abstract = {Critical security studies have emphasized that the identification of security threats paves the way for international and domestic interventions. Over the last three decades, statebuilding has developed into a powerful global practice of intervention in domestic affairs – not only with respect to failed states, but more broadly as a tool used in development cooperation and governance assistance. Statebuilding is increasingly framed as a policy which can enhance international, as well as domestic, security and peace, and yet historical and contemporary examples of statebuilding have often involved considerable violence. This volume draws on securitization studies to analyze the role of security in international and domestic statebuilding interventions. Individual case studies explore international statebuilding in Libya, Iraq, Kosovo, and Cameroon, discourses of intervention in the USA, and internal statebuilding in Turkey, Mexico, Tajikistan and South Sudan. These empirical investigations offer a compelling insight into the multiplicity, and global character, of security dynamics.},

Since 1979, David Bordwell, Kristin Thompson and now, Co-Author, Jeff Smith's Film Art has been the best-selling and most widely respected introduction to the analysis of cinema. Taking a skills-centered approach supported by examples from many periods and countries, the authors help students develop a core set of analytical skills that will enrich their understanding of any film, in any genre. In-depth examples deepen students' appreciation for how creative choices by filmmakers affect what viewers experience and how they respond. Film Art is generously illustrated with more than 1,000 frame enlargements taken directly from completed films, providing concrete illustrations of key concepts. Along with updated examples and expanded coverage of digital filmmaking, the eleventh edition of Film Art delivers SmartBook, first and only adaptive reading experience currently available, designed to help students stay focused, maximize study time and retain basic concepts." – Publisher's description},

  abstract = {La 4e de couverture indique: "The unprecedented increase in lesbian representation over the past two decades has, paradoxically, coincided with queer theory's radical transformation of the study of sexuality. In Lesbian Cinema after Queer Theory, Clara Bradbury-Rance argues that this contradictory context has yielded new kinds of cinematic language through which to give desire visual form. By offering close readings of key contemporary films such as Blue Is the Warmest Colour, Water Lilies and Carol alongside a broader filmography encompassing over 300 other films released between 1927 and 2018, the book provokes new ways of understanding a changing field of representation. Bradbury-Rance resists charting a narrative of representational progress or shoring up the lesbian's categorisation in the newly available terms of the visible. Instead, she argues for a feminist framework that can understand lesbianism's queerness. Drawing on a provocative theoretical and visual corpus, Lesbian Cinema after Queer Theory reveals the conditions of lesbian legibility in the twenty-first century"},

The diversity of ideology studies is represented by a mixture of the range of theories that illuminate the field, combined with an appreciation of the changing complexity of concrete ideologies and the emergence of new ones. Ideologies, however, are always with us. The Handbook is divided into three sections: The first is divided into three sections: The first reflects some of the latest thinking about the development of ideology on an historical dimension, from the standpoints of conceptual history, Marx studies, social science theory and history, and leading schools of continental philosophy. The second includes some of the most recent interpretations and theories of ideology, all of which are sympathetic in their own ways to its exploration and close investigation, even when judiciously critical of its social impact. This section contains many of the more salient contemporary accounts of ideology. The third focuses on the leading ideological families and traditions, as well as on some of their cultural and geographical manifestations, incorporating both historical and contemporary perspectives. Each chapter is written by an expert in their field, bringing the latest approaches and understandings to their task. The Handbook will position the study of ideologies in the mainstream of political theory and political analysis and will attest to its indispensability both to courses on political theory and to scholars who wish to take their understanding of ideologies in new directions.},

Diese wiederum soll vor dem Hintergrund der Entwicklung eines europäischen Systems der Migrationskontrolle, dessen Teil Polen nach 1989 geworden ist, betrachtet werden. Es handelt sich dabei, wie in diesem Kapitel gezeigt wird, um einen langwierigen Prozess, dessen Anfänge in die 1950er Jahre zurückreichen und der in seiner Entwicklung mehrere Etappen durchlaufen hat.},

  abstract = {In this report we focus on this administrative asylum agency on its own. There is little literature on the recognition policy of the Asylum Offices (AO) as the deliberations and decisions of the AO are in general not made public. With hindsight and most of all with archival material or personal interviews the interaction between the administration and the political actors can be reconstructed. However, to obtain insight into the decision-making process within the AO, one has to look into the discussions internal to the administration as the AO were, at times, merely an administrative unit within a larger department, which makes it opaque. Even access to decisions in individual cases is not straightforward due to privacy concerns: since the closure period is at least 50 years for material related to individuals, the researcher typically needs the permission of the persons concerned. Our analysis of AO protection practices in Europe is based on the historical and contemporary literature on the asylum agencies as well as on archival research and interviews with privileged time witnesses, mainly (former) leading officials of these institutions. Our analysis of the AO protection practices is embedded in the evolving immigration and asylum policies of the continental European states. The literature on these policy developments is largely dominated by legal scholars, only few political scientists and historians have examined this policy domain. The few who did work on these topics almost exclusively focused on one country. To juxtapose these national developments and compare the changes in Europe demanded a considerable effort to see difference and similarities.},

Second, each annual observation includes a host of new variables, ranging from the campaign’s observed participation size to the diversity of participation to the opponent’s response to third-part support to the strategic progress of the campaign. A few known coding errors in NAVCO 1.1 were corrected. NAVCO 2.1 supersedes these data; they are included here for archival purposes.},

  abstract = {Almost as long as cinema has existed, vampires have appeared on screen. Symbolizing an unholy union between sex and death, the vampire—male or female—has represented the libido, a “repressed force” that consumed its victims. Early iconic representations of male vampires were seen in Nosferatu (1922) and Dracula (1931), but not until Dracula’s Daughter in 1936 did a female “sex vampire” assume the lead. Other female vampires followed, perhaps most provocatively in the Hammer films of the 1950s, ’60s, and ’70s. Later incarnations, in such films as Near Dark (1987) and From Dusk till Dawn (1996), offered modern takes on this now iconic figure.In Dracula’s Daughters: The Female Vampire on Film, Douglas Brode and Leah Deyneka have assembled a varied collection of essays that explore this cinematic type that simultaneously frightens and seduces viewers. These essays address a number of issues raised by the female vampire film, such as violence perpetrated on and by women; reactions to the genre from feminists, antifeminists, and postfeminists; the implications of female vampire films for audiences both gay and straight; and how films reflected the period during which they were created. Other topics include female vampire films in relationship to vampire fiction, particularly by women such as Anne Rice; the relationship of the vampire myth to sexually transmitted diseases like AIDS; issues of race and misogyny; and the unique phenomenon of teen vampires in young adult books and films such as Twilight.Featuring more than thirty photos spanning several decades, this collection offers a compelling assessment of an archetypal figure—an enduring representation of dark desires—that continues to captivate audiences. This book will appeal not only to scholars and students but also to any lover of transgressive cinema.},

Die Analyse totalitärer Führer- und Parteiendiktaturen wurde in den 1960er und 1970er Jahren abgelöst vom Konzept des Autoritarismus (Brooker 2009). Mit der „dritten Demokratisierungswelle„ (1974 ff.) geriet die Autoritarismusforschung in den Schatten der Demokratisierungsstudien. Die Analyse nicht-demokratischer Regime blieb relevant, wurde aber vorrangig mit Blick auf die Chancen, Pfade und Herausforderungen der Demokratisierung und Konsolidierung post-autoritärer Regime betrieben (Ulfelder 2005).},

Ten years later, a new global landscape of public diplomacy has taken shape, with major programs in graduate-level public diplomacy studies worldwide. What separates this handbook from others is its legacy and continuity from the first edition. This first edition line-up was more military-focused than this edition, a legacy to the work of Philip M. Taylor, to whom this updated edition is dedicated. This edition includes U.S. content but all case studies are outside the U.S., not only to appeal to a global audience of scholars and practitioners, but also as a way of offering something fresher than the US/UK-centric competition. In Parts 1-4, original contributors are retained, many with revised editions, but new faces emerge. Parts 5 and 6 include sixteen global case studies in public diplomacy, expanding the number of contributors by ten. The concluding part of the book includes chapters on digital and corporate public diplomacy, and a signature final chapter on the Noosphere and Noopolitik as they relate to public diplomacy. Designed for a broad audience, The Routledge Handbook of Public Diplomacy is encyclopedic in its range and depth of content, yet is written in an accessible style that will appeal to both undergraduate and postgraduate students"--},

  abstract = {"... a work that builds a substantial bridge between Freudian psychoanalysis and radical feminist thought, particularly on the subject of lesbianism.... Presenting a complex argument about an issue vital to the psychoanalytic endeavor as well as to feminist theory, The Practice of Love should stimulate a reconsideration of 'perversion' and the construction of sexual fantasy. The illumination of the fantasies that make lesbian desire distinctive will necessarily open up our understanding of all sexuality." –Jessica Benjamin, New York Times Book Review "Teresa de Lauretis has entwined three books into one: a critical history of psychoanalytic theories of female homosexuality; a bold study of how lesbians keep disappearing from popular culture, especially film; and an original speculation on the dynamics of lesbian desire." –Elisabeth Young-Bruehl "An important and original contribution not only to lesbian and gay studies, but also to psychoanalytic theory and film criticism. De Lauretis brings a unique and valuable perspective to issues of great importance today in all these areas." –Leo Bersani "De Lauretis's influential theory gets top marks from sapphic scholars who know best." –Out In an eccentric reading of Freud through Laplanche and the Lacanian and feminist revisions, Teresa de Lauretis delineates a model of "perverse" desire and a theory of lesbian sexuality. The Practice of Love discusses classic psychoanalytic narratives of female homosexuality, contemporary feminist writings on female sexuality, and the evolution of the original fantasies into cultural myths or public fantasies.},

From gay space in Mexico City to the now legendary baths of New York and San Francisco, QUEERS IN SPACE travels to bars, parks, beaches, neighborhoods, and cities to follow the expansion and transformation of queer communities beyond the gay ghetto. By focusing on the geography of queer social relationships QUEERS IN SPACE raises critical and timely questions about the role of social space in shaping identities, the meaning of communal space for marginalized peoples, and the significance of public spaces for social visibility.

  abstract = {In 1947, officials at the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) established an unprecedented, worldwide literacy program. Simultaneously, however, officials at the World Bank refused to support educational programming, arguing that education-related projects could not guarantee a return on Bank investments. In 1962, however, World Bank lending policies began to shift. Lending for primary education increased from zero to 14 percent between 1963 and 1978 and overall Bank spending on education rose dramatically. During this same period, however, critics increasingly questioned the central principles upon which UNESCO officials established their organization's educational programming, fearing that the organization had come under communist influence. This paper reexamines the evolving priorities of United Nations organizations during the Cold War and the increasing politicization of economic development. It offers a critical reassessment of the role of the World Bank and UNESCO in negotiating the ideological conflict between capitalism and communism.},

What we find is that the stock of foreign students is an important predictor of subsequent migration. This holds true whether or not the lagged endogenous variable is included. The relationship is robust to the inclusion of time and country dummies, and remains when we account for outliers. The basic results also hold for a cross section of 36 countries of origin and 9 host countries. Our results have important policy implications which we discuss in the last section.},

  abstract = {This essay examines ways in which American social science in the late twentieth century was—and was not—a creature of the Cold War. It identifies important work by historians that calls into question the assumption that all social science during the Cold War amounts to “Cold War social science.” These historians attribute significant agency to social scientists, showing how they were enmeshed in both long‐running disciplinary discussions and new institutional environments. Key trends in this scholarship include a broadening historical perspective to see social scientists in the Cold War as responding to the ideas of their scholarly predecessors; identifying the institutional legacies of World War II; and examining in close detail the products of extramural—especially governmental—funding. The result is a view of social science in the Cold War in which national security concerns are relevant, but with varied and often unexpected impacts on intellectual life.}

An actor´s performance, driven by a posture and attitude inherent in the character he plays, is reinforced in the projection of his role, because it is framed by a dialectic in which the costumes, in its broadest sense - including make-up and accessories – constitutes a relevant item in the film narrative, in the fictional world, and in the shot composition. Emotions triggered simultaneously converge with the illusion of realism intended in the script and storytelling intended by the director.},

The textile universe, allied to mankind since its beginnings, is increasingly far from being an area of exhausted possibilities, each moment proposing important innovations that need a presentation, discussion and maturation space that is comprehensive and above all inter- and transdisciplinary. Presently, the disciplinary areas where the textile area is present are increasing and important, such as fashion, home textiles, technical clothing and accessories, but also construction and health, among others, and can provide new possibilities and different disciplinary areas and allowing the production of new knowledge. D\_TEX proposes to join the thinking of design, with technologies, tradition, techniques, and related areas, in a single space where ideas are combined with the technique and with the projectual and research capacity, thus providing for the creation of concepts, opinions, associations of ideas, links and connections that allow the conception of ideas, products and services. The interdisciplinary nature of design is a reality that fully reaches the textile material in its essence and its practical application, through the synergy and contamination by the different interventions that make up the multidisciplinary teams of research. The generic theme of D\_TEX Textile Design Conference 2017, held at Lisbon School of Architecture of the University of Lisbon, Portugal on November 2-4, 2017, is Design the Future, starting from the crossroads of ideas and debates, a new starting point for the exploration of textile materials, their identities and innovations in all their dimensions.},

We illustrate how the film turns in on itself and brings to the forefront questions about spectatorship, pleasure, and desire, thereby commenting on how the politics of visual representation are always fraught with contradictions and complexities. Ultimately, we argue that the self-referentiality of High Art draws spectators into spaces where the Ã¢â¬ËpositiveÃ¢â¬â¢ pleasure of easily consuming cinematic images is thrown into relief.},

From a fashion studies perspective, it examines the function of subcultural dress within queer communities and the mannerisms and messages that are used as signifiers of identity. Diverse dress is examined, including effeminate 'pansy,' masculine macho 'clone,' the 'lipstick' and 'butch' lesbian styles and the extreme styles of drag kings and drag queens. Divided into three main sections on history, subcultural identity and subcultural style, Queer Style will be of particular interest to students of dress and fashion as well as those coming to subculture from sociology and cultural studies.},

Gever traces the history of lesbians in popular culture during the twentieth century, from Radclyffe Hall and Greta Garbo to Martina Navratilova and Rosie O'Donnell, to explore the paradoxes inherent in lesbian celebrity.},

To do this, the first part of this article addresses the origin of this type of research within the History of Education. We then focus on analyzing the subsequent evolution that occurred with the beginning of the transnational turn and its impact on educational-historical research. Through a bibliographic review, we attempt to highlight the importance of studying international organizations, public diplomacy, the Cold War and Modernization Theory in order to understand the transformations that took place in educational systems worldwide during the second half of the 20th century. All these elements reveal more clearly the factors that made countries with different political regimes, cultural traditions or educational models begin to develop similar educational policies. Finally, this article points out the value of new research to understand the origin and development of certain policies at the international level.},

  abstract = {Immortal, Invisible: Lesbians and the Moving Image is the first collection to bring together leading film-makers, academics and activists to discuss films by, for and about lesbians and queer women. The contributors debate the practice of lesbian and queer film-making, from the queer cinema of Monika Treut to the work of lesbian film-makers Andrea Weiss and Greta Schiller. They explore the pleasures and problems of lesbian spectatorship, both in mainstream Hollywood films including Aliens and Red Sonja, and in independent cinema from She Must be Seeing Things to Salmonberries and Desert Hearts. The authors tackle tricky questions: can a film such as Strictly Ballroom be both pleasurably camp and heterosexist? Is it ok to drool over dyke icons like Sigourney Weaver and kd lang? What makes a film lesbian, or queer, or even post-queer? What about showing sex on screen? And why do lesbian screen romances hardly ever have happy endings? Immortal, Invisible is splendidly illustrated with a selection of images from film and television texts.},

At the institutional level, the drive towards a greater degree of latitude and autonomy has found a ready echo among universities and other establishments of higher education. And this, in its turn, has posed major questions about the range of responsibilities central government and administration ought to retain or to delegate.

  abstract = {In this quintessential work of queer theory, Jack Halberstam takes aim at the protected status of male masculinity and shows that female masculinity has offered a distinct alternative to it for well over two centuries. Demonstrating how female masculinity is not some bad imitation of virility, but a lively and dramatic staging of hybrid and minority genders, Halberstam catalogs the diversity of gender expressions among masculine women from nineteenth-century pre-lesbian practices to contemporary drag king performances.Through detailed textual readings as well as empirical research, Halberstam uncovers a hidden history of female masculinities while arguing for a more nuanced understanding of gender categories that would incorporate rather than pathologize them. He rereads Anne Lister's diaries and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness as foundational assertions of female masculine identity; considers the enigma of the stone butch and the politics surrounding butch/femme roles within lesbian communities; and explores issues of transsexuality among “transgender dykes”—lesbians who pass as men—and female-to-male transsexuals who may find the label of “lesbian” a temporary refuge. Halberstam also tackles such topics as women and boxing, butches in Hollywood and independent cinema, and the phenomenon of male impersonators.Featuring a new preface by the author, this twentieth anniversary edition of Female Masculinity remains as insightful, timely, and necessary as ever.},

  abstract = {Up to this year I have always felt that I had no particular call to meddle with this subject....But I feel now that the time is come when even a woman or a child who can speak a word for freedom and humanity is bound to speak. Thus did Harriet Beecher Stowe announce her decision to beginwork on what would become one of the most influential novels ever written. The subject she had hesitated to meddle with was slavery, and the novel, of course, was Uncle Tom's Cabin. Still debated today for its portrayal of African Americans and its unresolved place in the literary canon, Stowe'sbest-known work was first published in weekly installments from June 5, 1851 to April 1, 1852. It caused such a stir in both the North and South, and even in Great Britain, that when Stowe met President Lincoln in 1862 he is said to have greeted her with the words, So you are the little woman whowrote the book that created this great war! In this landmark book, the first full-scale biography of Harriet Beecher Stowe in over fifty years, Joan D. Hedrick tells the absorbing story of this gifted, complex, and contradictory woman. Hedrick takes readers into the multilayered world of nineteenth century morals and mores, exploring theinfluence of then-popular ideas of true womanhood on Stowe's upbringing as a member of the outspoken Beecher clan, and her eventful life as a writer and shaper of public opinion who was also a mother of seven. It offers a lively record of the flourishing parlor societies that launched andsustained Stowe throughout the 44 years of her career, and the harsh physical realities that governed so many women's lives. The epidemics, high infant mortality, and often disastrous medical practices of the day are portrayed in moving detail, against the backdrop of western expansion, and thegreat social upheaval accompanying the abolitionist movement and the entry of women into public life. Here are Stowe's public triumphs, both before and after the Civil War, and the private tragedies that included the death of her adored eighteen month old son, the drowning of another son, and the alcohol and morphine addictions of two of her other children. The daughter, sister, and wife ofprominent ministers, Stowe channeled her anguish and her ambition into a socially acceptable anger on behalf of others, transforming her private experience into powerful narratives that moved a nation. Magisterial in its breadth and rich in detail, this definitive portrait explores the full measure of Harriet Beecher Stowe's life, and her contribution to American literature. Perceptive and engaging, it illuminates the career of a major writer during the transition of literature from anamateur pastime to a profession, and offers a fascinating look at the pains, pleasures, and accomplishments of women's lives in the last century.},

"Loving The L Word" picks up where Reading "The L Word: Outing Contemporary Television" (I.B. Tauris, 2006) left off. With new, updated chapters by many of the same television writers and scholars who contributed to the first volume, as well as essays by some newcomers, "Loving The L Word" explores the series' quantum contribution to the ongoing evolution of queer television. Whether you loved "The L Word", hated it, or loved to hate it, this book recognizes that the show transformed the post-Ellen LGBT television landscape, fulfilling a long-neglected, visceral desire for lesbian stories and images. In the process, it reshaped the communities that follow and talk about queer television and care about the narratives and characters that drive it. Including complete Character/Actor, Film/TV and Episode guides, the book also proceeds from the understanding that while "The L Word' ended in 2009 it manages to live on - in the lives of its fans, as well as in a new reality spin-off, "The Real L Word".},

  abstract = {2016 Choice Outstanding Academic Title Finalist for 2016 Richard Wall Memorial Award by the Theatre Library  Long listed for the 2017 Kraszna-Krausz Best Photography Book Award from the Kraszna-Krausz Foundation Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, and Katharine Hepburn all made lasting impressions with the cinematic cross-dressing they performed onscreen. What few modern viewers realize, however, is that these seemingly daring performances of the 1930s actually came at the tail end of a long wave of gender-bending films that included more than 400 movies featuring women dressed as men.   Laura Horak spent a decade scouring film archives worldwide, looking at American films made between 1908 and 1934, and what she discovered could revolutionize our understanding of gender roles in the early twentieth century. Questioning the assumption that cross-dressing women were automatically viewed as transgressive, she finds that these figures were popularly regarded as wholesome and regularly appeared onscreen in the 1910s, thus lending greater respectability to the fledgling film industry. Horak also explores how and why this perception of cross-dressed women began to change in the 1920s and early 1930s, examining how cinema played a pivotal part in the representation of lesbian identity.  Girls Will Be Boys excavates a rich history of gender-bending film roles, enabling readers to appreciate the wide array of masculinities that these actresses performed—from sentimental boyhood to rugged virility to gentlemanly refinement. Taking us on a guided tour through a treasure-trove of vintage images, Girls Will Be Boys helps us view the histories of gender, sexuality, and film through fresh eyes.},

  abstract = {"Text data is important for many domains, from healthcare to marketing to the digital humanities, but specialized approaches are necessary to create features for machine learning from language. Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R explains how to preprocess text data for modeling, train models, and evaluate model performance using tools from the tidyverse and tidymodels ecosystem. Models like these can be used to make predictions for new observations, to understand what natural language features or characteristics contribute to differences in the output, and more. If you are already familiar with the basics of predictive modeling, use the comprehensive, detailed examples in this book to extend your skills to the domain of natural language processing"--},

  abstract = {In recent years, sociological research on cosmopolitanism has begun to draw on Pierre Bourdieu to critically examine how cosmopolitanism is implicated in stratification on an increasingly global scale. In this paper, we examine the analytical potential of the Bourdieusian approach by exploring how education systems help to institutionalize cosmopolitanism as cultural capital whose access is rendered structurally unequal. To this end, we first probe how education systems legitimate cosmopolitanism as a desirable disposition at the global level, while simultaneously distributing it unequally among different groups of actors according to their geographical locations and volumes of economic, cultural, and social capital their families possess. We then explore how education systems undergird profitability of cosmopolitanism as cultural capital by linking academic qualifications that signal cosmopolitan dispositions with the growing number of positions that require extensive interactions with people of multiple nationalities.},

  abstract = {Heterosexuality is a largely ‘silent’ set of practices and identities – it is assumed to be everywhere and yet often remains unnamed and unexplored. Despite recent changes in the theoretical understanding and representation of sexuality, heterosexuality continues to be socially normative. Forging a new agenda for the study of heterosexuality, this in-depth volume, the first research monograph to focus on heterosexuality and society, presents an empirical study of the construction, negotiation and enactment of heterosexual sexuality. Using detailed interview data, it investigates how heterosexuality, as both an identity and a set of practices, is accomplished through love relationships. Rather than assuming that romantic love is an outcome or expression of a pre-defined sexuality, Johnson explores how sexuality is brought to life through love. Situated in the ongoing theoretical debates concerning the relationship between gender and sexuality, Paul Johnson’s book shows how ways of loving are interwoven with the construction, practice, regulation and government of heterosexuality. Excellently written, this important book also looks at gender in society, and explores such areas as heterosexual subjectivities and the borders of desire. As such, the research it contains will be valuable for all students of sociology and gender studies.},

Die in den Beiträgen geschilderten Ereignisse werden also in der Regel aus der Sicht dieser Gruppen wiedergegeben. Der zeitliche Schwerpunkt ergibt sich aus der Hochkonjunktur der „maoistischen” oder „marxistisch-leninistischen Bewegung”: Anfang bis Mitte der 70er Jahre. Recherchen zu hier noch nicht behandelten Themen können über die Autoren angefordert werden. Ebenso die veröffentlichten Scans, die meist in einer weit höheren Auflösung existieren.

Following the career and artistic work of Dhamo is very interesting as he is one of the most talented Albanian film directors as well as the author of the first long feature film produced in Albania, entitled Tana (1958)},

  abstract = {Critical in policy analysis is not only the question whether it works. One needs to know *how* it works. This is a question about causal mechanisms. In this exemplary volume the authors provide some generic mechanisms that can apply in variety of settings along with detailed case studies of mechanisms in individual countries. It is essential reading for all those interested in social policy. - Gary Goertz, University of Notre Dame, USA Causal mechanisms meet social policy research in this masterful volume that offers clear theoretical and methodological guidance, while providing concrete examples from across the world. Kuhlmann, Nullmeier, and the impressive group of scholars they have gathered offer an innovative mechanism-based approach to study social policy processes that elegantly fuses the actions of policy actors with complex theory-centered causal sequences. This book’s theoretical and methodological insights make it a must-read for social policy scholars across disciplines. - Sara Niedzwiecki, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA This open access edited volume introduces the concept of causal mechanisms to explore new ways of explaining the global dynamics of social policy, and shows that a mechanism-based approach provides several advantages over established approaches for studying social policy. The introductory chapter outlines the mechanism-based approach, which stands out by modularisation and a clear focus on actors. The mechanism-based approach then guides the twelve chapters on social policy developments in different Asian, African, European and Latin American countries. Based on these findings, the concluding chapter provides a structured compilation of causal mechanisms and outlines how a mechanism-based approach can further strengthen research on the global development of social policies, especially in a comparative perspective. The edited volume is highly relevant for social policy scholars from a variety of disciplines, as well as for scholars interested in strengthening explanation in the social sciences. Johanna Kuhlmann is Postdoctoral Researcher at the SOCIUM Research Center on Inequality and Social Policy, University of Bremen, Germany. Frank Nullmeier is Professor of Political Science at the SOCIUM Research Center on Inequality and Social, University of Bremen, Germany},

  abstract = {In this thesis I describe and analyze the development of teacher education in Albania from the 1830s, known as the \emph{Rilindja Kombëtare Shqiptare}* (National Awakening) period, all the way to the present This focus is highlighted against the general background of Albanian politics and education as a whole. I investigate the historical, social and political factors influencing the development of teacher education, its structure, changes in the teacher education curriculum to respond to the changing political contexts, as well as changes of the status of teachers in different periods. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$}I show that education, status and supply of teachers is a very useful litmus paper issue which reflects almost every tension and problem besetting the Albanian state over the past century or more such as its economic poverty, its cultural and political marginality, its problems of geographical, religious and linguistic division, its uncertain borders and exposure to foreign exploitation. My ambition and determination is to place Albania within a powerful west European tradition. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$}The thesis is divided into three sections; The \emph{first section} examines the literature relating to developments in teacher education in other countries as well as the underpinning issues. I introduce six guiding concepts developed from the literature with regard to: {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} \emph{Firstly}, the development of teacher education in Albania influenced by the changing nature of the political and social control and influence, \emph{secondly}, the importance of social, economic and political factors in forming societal perceptions of teacher status, \emph{thirdly}, the evolution of teacher education, \emph{fourthly}, the emergence of pre-communist ideas once the political control and influence loosened, \emph{fifthly}, the influence of global developments on the content of teacher education, \emph{sixthly}, the involvement of a wider number of interest groups in debates around the nature and quality of teacher education. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} \emph{The second section} describes the development of teacher education in Albania from the period of the \emph{Rilindja Kombëtare Shqiptare} (1830) to the present. I examine these developments as they relate to the historical and political developments at a given period. Reference is made with regard to important individuals who exercised their influence on developments on teacher education. I also point to the breaks and ruptures that take place due to the political and historical factors. This section also considers the increasing public expectations of teacher education. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$}\emph{In the third section} I return to the six original guiding concepts and discuss the key findings in relation to the importance of historical, political social and economic factors that have influenced the development of teacher education in Albania; the stages of these developments and their nature; the social perceptions of teacher education and teacher status; the development of teacher education in Albania versus global developments and public expectations about the quality and nature of teacher education. Finally I provide conclusions drawn from the analysis. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$}The thesis makes an important contribution to knowledge in providing: {$<$}br{$>$}a) A public written account, which constitutes the only coherent and solidly based work in English on Albanian teacher education on a national and international scale.{$<$}br{$>$}b) Analysis of teacher education as a political process more sharply evident in Albania than in most countries because of the sudden and radical character of successive political changes and the exposure of the system to external forces.{$<$}br{$>$}Within that analysis there is clear evidence that changes in teacher education were a local variant of changes compared to other Central and Eastern European countries in the decades after 1945. However, the thesis makes it evident that strong European tradition remained alive during decades and has become influential even today.}

  abstract = {Violent Women in Contemporary Cinema explores the representation of homicidal women in six contemporary films: Antichrist (Lars von Trier, 2009), Trouble Every Day (Claire Denis, 2001), Baise-moi (Coralie Thinh Thi and Virginie Despentes, 2000), Heavenly Creatures (Peter Jackson, 1994), Monster (Patty Jenkins, 2003) and The Reader (Stephen Daldry, 2008). Violent women in cinema pose an exciting challenge to viewers when women kill, they overturn cultural ideas of 'typical' feminine behaviour. Janice Loreck explores how cinema creatively depicts the violent woman in response to this challenge. Departing from earlier studies that focus on popular and exploitation cinema, the book takes a unique focus on violent women in art films and other critically-distinguished forms. It explores the appeal that the violent woman holds for spectators within this viewing context. Furthermore, the book also examines how cinema responds to the cultural construction of the violent woman as a conundrum and enigma.},

  abstract = {The last decade featured the emergence of a significant and growing literature concerning comparative-historical methods. This literature offers methodological tools for causal and descriptive inference that go beyond the techniques currently available in mainstream statistical analysis. In terms of causal inference, new procedures exist for testing hypotheses about necessary and sufficient causes, and these procedures address the skepticism that mainstream methodologists may hold about necessary and sufficient causation. Likewise, new techniques are available for analyzing hypotheses that refer to complex temporal processes, including path-dependent sequences. In the area of descriptive inference, the comparative-historical literature offers important tools for concept analysis and for achieving measurement validity. Given these contributions, comparative-historical methods merit a central place within the general field of social science methodology.}

  abstract = {Through films that alternate between containment, order, and symmetry on the one hand, and obsession, explosiveness, and a lack of control on the other, Chantal Akerman has gained a reputation as one of the most significant filmmakers working today. Her 1975 film Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles is widely regarded as the most important feminist film of that decade. In Nothing Happens, Ivone Margulies presents the first comprehensive study of this influential avant-garde Belgian filmmaker. Margulies grounds her critical analysis in detailed discussions of Akerman's work–from Saute ma ville, a 13-minute black-and-white film made in 1968, through Jeanne Dielman and Je tu il elle to the present. Focusing on the real-time representation of a woman's everyday experience in Jeanne Dielman, Margulies brings the history of social and progressive realism and the filmmaker's work into perspective. Pursuing two different but related lines of inquiry, she investigates an interest in the everyday that stretches from postwar neorealist cinema to the feminist rewriting of women's history in the seventies. She then shows how Akerman's "corporeal cinema" is informed by both American experiments with performance and duration and the layerings present in works by European modernists Bresson, Rohmer, and Dreyer. This analysis revises the tired opposition between realism and modernism in the cinema, defines Akerman's minimal-hyperrealist aesthetics in contrast to Godard's anti-illusionism, and reveals the inadequacies of popular characterizations of Akerman's films as either simply modernist or feminist. An essential book for students of Chantal Akerman's work, Nothing Happens will also interest international film critics and scholars, filmmakers, art historians, and all readers concerned with feminist film theory.},

  abstract = {A New York Times bestsellerThe original graphic novel adapted into the film Blue Is the Warmest Color, winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2013 Cannes Film FestivalIn this tender, bittersweet, full-color graphic novel, a young woman named Clementine discovers herself and the elusive magic of love when she meets a confident blue-haired girl named Emma: a lesbian love story for the ages that bristles with the energy of youth and rebellion and the eternal light of desire.First published in France by Glénat, the book has won several awards, including the Audience Prize at the Angoulême International Comics Festival, Europe's largest.The live-action, French-language film version of the book, entitled Blue Is the Warmest Color, won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2013. Directed by director Abdellatif Kechiche and starring Lea Seydoux and Adele Exarchopoulos, the film generated both wide praise and controversy. It will be released in the US through Sundance Selects/IFC Films.Julie Maroh is an author and illustrator originally from northern France."Julie Maroh, who was just 19 when she started the comic, manages to convey the excitement, terror, and obsession of young love—and to show how wildly teenagers swing from one extreme emotion to the next ... Ultimately, Blue Is the Warmest Color is a sad story about loss and heartbreak, but while Emma and Clementine’s love lasts, it’s exhilarating and sustaining." —Slate.com"A beautiful, moving graphic novel." —Wall Street Journal"Blue Is the Warmest Color captures the entire life of a relationship in affecting and honest style." —Comics Worth Reading"Delicate linework conveys wordless longing in this graphic novel about a lesbian relationship." —New York Times Book Review (Editor's Choice)"A tragic yet beautifully wrought graphic novel." —Salon.com"Love is a beautiful punishment in Maroh’s paean to confusion, passion, and discovery ... An elegantly impassioned love story." —Publishers Weekly (STARRED REVIEW)"A lovely and wholehearted coming-out story ... the illustrations are infused with genuine, raw feeling. Wide-eyed Clementine wears every emotion on her sleeve, and teens will understand her journey perfectly." —Kirkus Reviews "The electric emotions of falling in love and the difficult process of self-acceptance will resonate with all readers ... Maroh’s use of color is deliberate enough to be eye-catching in a world of grey tones, with Emma’s bright blue hair capturing Clementine’s imagination, but is used sparingly enough that it supports and blends naturally with the story." —Library Journal (STARRED REVIEW)"It's not just the French who have a better handle on sexy material than Americans – Canadians do, too ... Who's publishing it? Not an American publishing house but by Arsenal Pulp Press, a Canadian independent." —Los Angeles Times},

  abstract = {On June 28, 1970, two thousand gay and lesbian activists in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago paraded down the streets of their cities in a new kind of social protest, one marked by celebration, fun, and unashamed declaration of a stigmatized identity. Forty-five years later, over six million people annually participate in 115 Pride parades across the United States. They march with church congregations and college gay-straight alliance groups, perform dance routines and marching band numbers, and gather with friends to cheer from the sidelines. With vivid imagery, and showcasing the voices of these participants, Pride Parades tells the story of Pride from its beginning in 1970 to 2010. Though often dismissed as frivolous spectacles, the author builds a convincing case for the importance of Pride parades as cultural protests at the heart of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community. Weaving together interviews, archival reports, quantitative data, and ethnographic observations at six diverse contemporary parades in New York City, Salt Lake City, San Diego, Burlington, Fargo, and Atlanta, Bruce describes how Pride parades are a venue for participants to challenge the everyday cultural stigma of being queer in America, all with a flair and sense of fun absent from typical protests. Unlike these political protests that aim to change government laws and policies, Pride parades are coordinated, concerted attempts to improve the standing of LGBT people in American culture.},

The collection of essays examines films such as The Talented Mr. Ripley, The Two Faces of January, and Carol, includes interviews with Highsmith adaptors and provides a comprehensive filmography of all existing Highsmith adaptations. Particular attention is paid to queer subtexts, mythological underpinnings, philosophical questioning, contrasting media environments and formal conventions in diverse generic contexts. Produced over the space of seventy years, these adaptations reflect broad cultural and material shifts in film production and critical approaches to film studies. The book is thus not only of interest to Highsmith admirers but to anyone interested in adaptation and transatlantic film history},

  abstract = {Melodrama: Genre, Style and Sensibility is designed as an accessible overview of one of the most popular genres at undergraduate Film Studies. The book identifies three distinct but connected concepts through which it is possible to make sense of melodrama; either as a genre, originating in European theatre of the 18th and 19th century, as a specific cinematic style, epitomised by the work of Douglas Sirk or as a sensibility that emerges in the context of specific texts, speaking to and reflecting the desires, concerns and anxieties of audiences. Films discussed include All That Heaven Allows, Safe, Fear Eats the Soul, Black Narcissus, Suddenly Last Summer and Rebel Without a Cause. Each chapter includes overviews of key essays, analyses of significant and widely studied films and includes an annotated reading list.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The paper describes and discusses the variant of societal differentiation that evolved under the Soviet regime. The argumentation starts with the conceptualisation of socialism as a program with a universal, function system-exceeding claim for validity. The implementation of the socialist program may be perceived as an effort to create structures which allow complete inclusion in the sense of an all-encompassing political addressability. In this regard, the political leadership tried to set up the society as a hierarchically structured organisation. The example of Soviet agriculture and the structures of Soviet villages, however, show that notwithstanding an all-encompassing degree of organisation, strictly ‘organised’ forms of economic communication coexisted with and were interrelated to ‘non-organisable’ and even ideologically deviant forms of agricultural production by personal smallholdings. Such niches of functional differentiation did not only provide compensation for the inability of the political leadership to cope with societal complexity, but also created connectivity in the world society and could hardly be oppressed without putting the stability of the regime at risk.},

  abstract = {The Cold War division of Europe was not inevitable--the acclaimed author of Stalin's Genocides shows how postwar Europeans fought to determine their own destinies. Was the division of Europe after World War II inevitable? In this powerful reassessment of the postwar order in Europe, Norman Naimark suggests that Joseph Stalin was far more open to a settlement on the continent than we have thought. Through revealing case studies from Poland and Yugoslavia to Denmark and Albania, Naimark recasts the early Cold War by focusing on Europeans' fight to determine their future. As nations devastated by war began rebuilding, Soviet intentions loomed large. Stalin's armies controlled most of the eastern half of the continent, and in France and Italy, communist parties were serious political forces. Yet Naimark reveals a surprisingly flexible Stalin, who initially had no intention of dividing Europe. During a window of opportunity from 1945 to 1948, leaders across the political spectrum, including Juho Kusti Paasikivi of Finland, Wladyslaw Gomulka of Poland, and Karl Renner of Austria, pushed back against outside pressures. For some, this meant struggling against Soviet dominance. For others, it meant enlisting the Americans to support their aims. The first frost of Cold War could be felt in the tense patrolling of zones of occupation in Germany, but not until 1948, with the coup in Czechoslovakia and the Berlin Blockade, did the familiar polarization set in. The split did not become irreversible until the formal division of Germany and establishment of NATO in 1949. In illuminating how European leaders deftly managed national interests in the face of dominating powers, Stalin and the Fate of Europe reveals the real potential of an alternative trajectory for the continent.--},

  abstract = {From the beginning of the modern era, Western universities played the most important role in preparing the Romanian elite. We cannot talk about a Romanian higher education network before 1864, when the universities of Iasi and Bucharest were set up, to which two more universities were added in 1919 in Cluj and in Cernăuti. Even so, due to the weakness of the Romanian higher education system, for a long time the "other Europe" was the only reliable and respected source of education for the Romanian youth with higher intellectual, social and political aspirations. Relevant is the fact that due to the deficiencies of Romanian higher education, as well as the mirage of Western countries, foreign universities held a monopoly in the formation of the local intellectual elite. One can estimate, without exaggeration, that between 1860-1918, almost all ministers, members of ministerial cabinets, university professors and other high state officials had been educated abroad. Only by taking into account this fact can we explain the rapid transformations of Romanian elites and the gradual changes of all other, more deep-seated layers of society and the way changes of content and spirit in the national culture were possible following Western models, which up to that point were strongly influenced by the Oriental and Orthodox world. The explanation is more complex, not only taking into account the ethno-psychological features of Romanians, but also the post-war strategy of France. In other words, France manifested a profound desire to compensate the decline of French military and economic power with cultural preeminence, encouraging the presence of foreign students in its universities. After 1920 the Romanian students participated in this strategy as the promoters of French customs and lifestyle in their home country. Romanian students were most numerous in the faculties of law and medicine, and they were almost invariably the most represented foreign group in all faculties during the interwar period.},

But over the past decade or so, a vast literature has emerged of personal narrative, apologetic, and polemic, asserting both the existence and acceptability of such dual identities.Que(e)rying Religion includes but moves beyond tradition-based experiential writing by turning to the academic study of religion. It includes work that compares or focuses on different religious traditions, such as various forms of Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Native American spiritualities. It also incorporates writing on various geographical areas and historical time periods. By assuming a wide definition of religion, it raises questions about the terms religion and religious themselves.Read together, the contents of Que(e)rying Religion provide access to a broad selection of work at the intersection of religious studies and lesbian/gay/queer studies.},

  abstract = {Getting a good picture is like diving for pearls. You take a thousand pictures to get a good one. -Nan GoldinIn her newest work, Nan Goldin merges her deep admiration for the artworks of the past with a lifelong dedication to her most immediate circle of friends. Invited by the Louvre, she photographed artworks of her choice at the museum and, guided by aesthetic and associative considerations, connected them to earlier photographs of her friends and lovers. In this way she not only draws inspiration from the rich sources of art history but revisits her own oeuvre of the last 40 years. The striking similarities between the two different pictorial worlds exert an intense dynamic on the viewer. The series, which yielded over 400 photographs, was shown for the first time in its full scope at the Kestnergesellschaft in Hannover, Germany. For this occasion, Diving for Pearls was conceived as an independent artist book which, alongside Goldin's newest work Saints, contains a selection of photographs that have never been published before. Nan Goldin was born in Washington, DC, in 1953 and is one of the most eminent female photographers of our times. She studied at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Since 1982 she has visited and worked in Berlin on a regular basis. She received a Hasselblad Photography Award in 2007. Goldin lives in Berlin, New York and Paris.},

From its reception of Ovid’s Metamorphoses to ideas espoused by the eighteenth-century art critic and philosopher Denis Diderot, Portrait looks to traditionally peripheral spaces, or edgelands, and the visual and embodied consequences of transcending them. Engaging closely with eighteenthcentury processes of artmaking, the film transforms sketches on paper, paint applied to canvas and wood, miniatures held close to the body and erotica annotated in the margins into queer-coded sites used to reflect and document the developing relationship at its heart.},

  abstract = {Higher education legislation is frequently changed by policy makers, who are acutely conscious that specific changes have repercussions through the law of general applicability, and eventually may alter and revise fundamental societal concepts. However, normative systems are complex, and the impact and direction of legal and social repercussions are neither always intended, nor are they easily foreseen. It is the purpose of this book to identify the chosen directions, and to contribute to the further development of issues in the higher education and research sector and to trace beginnings of new trends. This volume is intended to appeal to the reader's personal, practical perspective to help generate the creativity and inspiration needed in order to maintain the equilibrium between consolidation and change. In the Council of Europe, much thought has been given to these problems in recent years. The Higher Education and Research Committee (CC-HER), previously known as the Standing Conference of University Problems (CC-PU), has established a Legislation Reform Programme for Higher Education (LRP). The Programme is intended to give effective support to the process of legislative reform in higher education, particularly, but not exclusively, in the new member states in central and eastern Europe. To promote dissemination of experience acquired throughout Europe and as a complement to its ongoing advisory and multilateral activities, the Programme's Steering Group has decided to publish a series entitled Legislating for Higher Education and Research in Europe'. The first volume of this series, "Relations between State and Higher" "Education," is hereby presented to the general public."Relations between State and Higher Education" has been compiled in close co-operation with States Parties to the European Cultural Convention. It seeks, as will subsequent volumes, to identify core issues which countries may need to confront in their legislations, and offers examples of good practice.},

  abstract = {[This article uses the case of Albanian nationalism during the period of Italy's occupation of Albania (1939-1943) to challenge prevailing conceptions of nationalism that define it primarily as a political doctrine that espouses national selfrule. Using archival research, the article discusses the nationalist discourse of Albania's pro-Italian political and cultural elites during Italian domination and examines the discursive strategies employed by these elites in reconciling nationalism with foreign domination. Among other techniques, the article shows how both empire and fascism's claim to universality enabled such reconciliation. More fundamentally, the article shows how nationalism's historical power does not primarily lie in the enunciation of a political doctrine of national self-rule, but rather its constitution of the "inner" cultural sphere of the nation around the problem of split temporality, in which tradition and modernity co-exist disharmoniously. The resolution of this cultural problem requires the exercise of state power within both the political and cultural realms, a solution that Albanian nationalists saw in empire and fascism.]}

  abstract = {"This book provides a comprehensive examination of the Albanian Student Movement of 1990-1991. To date, there are no thorough studies of the first year of the transition in Albania, which constitutes the most critical period of transition. The lessons to be learned are vast and of great importance to the debates on social movements, mobilization and transition. Renowned scholars of modern Albanian history, led by the former leader of the Albanian Student Movement, Shinasi A. Rama, provide a study of the critical role played by this movement in the political transformation of Albania from a totalitarian cult-state to a multiparty political system during 1990-1991. Their informed analysis combined with first-hand knowledge of the events during a key period of the Albanian history shed light on the student movement, its ideology, values, contributions, and its relationship to the system and to the ruling caste. The authors come to the core conclusion that the student movement remained an independent player that achieved change in the political system at a crucial juncture. The End of Communist Rule in Albania is a much-needed contribution in the fields of social movements, democratization studies, Communist and Post-Communist politics, Albanian Studies"--},

  abstract = {B. Ruby Rich designated a brand new genre, the New Queer Cinema (NQC), in her groundbreaking article in the Village Voice in 1992. This movement in film and video was intensely political and aesthetically innovative, made possible by the debut of the camcorder, and driven initially by outrage over the unchecked spread of AIDS. The genre has grown to include an entire generation of queer artists, filmmakers, and activists.As a critic, curator, journalist, and scholar, Rich has been inextricably linked to the New Queer Cinema from its inception. This volume presents her new thoughts on the topic, as well as bringing together the best of her writing on the NQC. She follows this cinematic movement from its origins in the mid-1980s all the way to the present in essays and articles directed at a range of audiences, from readers of academic journals to popular glossies and weekly newspapers. She presents her insights into such NQC pioneers as Derek Jarman and Isaac Julien and investigates such celebrated films as Go Fish, Brokeback Mountain, Itty Bitty Titty Committee, and Milk. In addition to exploring less-known films and international cinemas (including Latin American and French films and videos), she documents the more recent incarnations of the NQC on screen, on the web, and in art galleries.},

  abstract = {Twenty-first century media has increasingly turned to provocative sexual content to generate buzz and stand out within a glut of programming. New distribution technologies enable and amplify these provocations, and encourage the branding of media creators as "provocauteurs" known for challenging sexual conventions and representational norms.While such strategies may at times be no more than a profitable lure, the most probing and powerful instances of sexual provocation serve to illuminate, question, and transform our understanding of sex and sexuality. In Provocauteurs and Provocations, award-winning author Maria San Filippo looks at the provocative in films, television series, web series and videos, entertainment industry publicity materials, and social media discourses and explores its potential to create alternative, even radical ways of screening sex. Throughout this edgy volume, San Filippo reassesses troubling texts and divisive figures, examining controversial strategies—from "real sex" scenes to scandalous marketing campaigns to full-frontal nudity—to reveal the critical role that sexual provocation plays as an authorial signature and promotional strategy within the contemporary media landscape.},

  abstract = {Celluloid Activist is the biography of gay-rights giant Vito Russo, the man who wrote The Celluloid Closet: Homosexuality in the Movies, commonly regarded as the foundational text of gay and lesbian film studies and one of the first to be widely read. But Russo was much more than a pioneering journalist and author. A founding member of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) and cofounder of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), Russo lived at the center of the most important gay cultural turning points in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. His life as a cultural Zelig intersects a crucial period of social change, and in some ways his story becomes the story of a developing gay revolution in America. A frequent participant at “zaps” and an organizer of Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) cabarets and dances—which gave the New York gay and lesbian community its first social alternative to Mafia-owned bars—Russo made his most enduring contribution to the GAA with his marshaling of “Movie Nights,” the forerunners to his worldwide Celluloid Closet lecture tours that gave gay audiences their first community forum for the dissection of gay imagery in mainstream film. Biographer Michael Schiavi unravels Vito Russo’s fascinating life story, from his childhood in East Harlem to his own heartbreaking experiences with HIV/AIDS. Drawing on archival materials, unpublished letters and journals, and more than two hundred interviews, including conversations with a range of Russo’s friends and family from brother Charlie Russo to comedian Lily Tomlin to pioneering activist and playwright Larry Kramer, Celluloid Activistprovides an unprecedented portrait of a man who defined gay-rights and AIDS activism. “Schiavi tells a compelling story in this biography—from his re-creation of life on the streets of East Harlem and in Greenwich Village of the 1960s and 1970s to the way he conveys Russo’s excitement about his film research and popular education to his account of the AIDS years in New York City.”—John D’Emilio, Italian American Review “In [Schiavi’s] hands Russo’s life is both fascinating in its own right and a window into a larger milieu of activism during two critical decades.”—Italian American Review Best Special Interest Books, selected by the American Association of School Librarians Best Books for General Audiences, selected by the Public Library Reviewers Finalist, Gay Memoir/Biography, Lambda Literary Awards Finalist, Over the Rainbow Selection, American Library Association},

It was an important book because it argued that "sexuality" and "desire" were not a historical phenomenon but carefully managed social constructs. This insight (that actually originated with Michael Foucault) is often viewed as anti-humanist or post-humanist because it argues that men and women are simply the products of patriarchal power relations over which they have no control. By mobilizing Foucault's theories of the history of sexuality Sedgwick re-fashions Feminism and Gay and Lesbian Studies to make it seem as though Feminism and Gay and Lesbian studies are ideally situated to continue those interventions into the history of sexuality begun by Foucault.},

  abstract = {Soviet-Albanian friendship matured mainly during the years of the war against fascism and Nazism (1939-1945). The Albanian people showed great courage in this war. Many thousands of Albanians (28 thousand) died in the battles for the liberation of the country. By the way, at that time the entire population of Albania was about one million people. Preserved, touching memories of the older generation of military meetings with Soviet people, which indicates the great sympathy that the Albanians had for the Soviet people. For example, in the 1950-1960s, whole legends were told about the arrival in Albania in 1943 of Major Ivanov, an adviser to the Soviet army, such stories were passed down, as is customary, from generation to generation. In November 1944, the Albanians finally won their long-awaited freedom. Instead of a monarchy, the People's Republic of Albania was born. After Germany's surrender, the Soviet Union became the young republic's closest and most reliable friend. Since then, the friendly relations between our peoples have acquired, it seemed, the character of the closest cooperation. With the help of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of Albania laid the foundations of the national economy. Albania's own industrial base was established. A large number of modern industrial enterprises were under construction. Hundreds of Soviet specialists worked in Albania every year. They introduced modern technologies in industry and agriculture, helped to master new machines, machinery and equipment. It is no exaggeration to say that the Albanians then treated the Soviet people, indeed, like older brothers. Hundreds of young Albanians studied in the Soviet Union. Many of them fell in love with this country and the great Russian culture, with which they then introduced their compatriots. They successfully used the acquired knowledge in their homeland. In 1957 they organized the first University in Tirana. Among the students, students in the Soviet Union, there were many who entered into mixed marriages, which brought our peoples even closer, tying them by blood ties. Trade relations developed successfully. The Soviet Union supplied Albania with machinery and equipment and consumer goods. Albania sent bitumen, copper, tobacco, citrus fruits, olive oil and olives to the Soviet Union. Cultural ties are widespread. In 1955, with the help of the Soviet Union, the Albanian film studio was built and put into operation, famous Soviet artists and creative groups came to Albania. At the same time, the Soviet audience fell in love with the Albanian singers Avni Mulya, Joni Atanas, Ibrahim Tukichi, Mentor Jemali, Rosemary Yorganji and the first joint Albano Soviet film "The Great Warrior of Albania Skanderbeg". Until 1959, outstanding figures such as the current President of Albania Alfred Moisiu, Former Ministers of Agriculture Shambla Petit and Dodbib Piro, as well as the most famous people in Albania such as Bayraktari Faik, Chele Burkhan, Kubaty Sali, Lachay Khusen, Murai Dzhelyo, studied in the USSR. Spano Shutyuri, Bogdani Dimitar, Chele Tare, Pasco Sotir, Babameto Enver, Misiri Nejmedin, Prift Skender, Chakaly Pole, Maryani Stavr, Fico Luan, Leli Agofokli, Rakai Ndots, Juveli Meno, Rapai Pabriretiro, Fendo Lazero , Mucho Abedin, Yanche Dimitar, Agola Dritero, Mula Avni, Atanas John, Tukichi Ibrahim, Jemali Mentor, Zade Chesk, Yorganji Rosemary, Kache Luk, America Bekir, Budina Dimosten, Spahia Fadil, Dragovoy Muharem, Shahe Angel, Pumo Muntas, Zhdemali Khale, Malyai Dino, Didi Rezmie and many others. Until 1960, more than 250 Albanian students studied in the USSR. On April 28, 1958, many outstanding people of the Soviet Union gathered in Moscow to create the Society of Soviet-Albanian Friendship, I will name some of them: member of the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences Arseniev A.M., Armenian composer A.G. Harutunyan, Doctor of Historical Sciences Blavatsky V. D., vice-rector of Moscow State University Galkin I.S., writer Gulia Georgi, doctor of philological sciences Desnitskaya A.V., Azerbaijani composer Kara-Abulfas Ogly Karaev, deputy minister of culture Kondakov I.P. collective farm chairman Mogamedov Mogamet, screenwriter Papava M.G., deputy chairman of the Uz.OKS Saidov B.F., deputy chairman of the presidium of the society of friendship with foreign countries Sizov N.T., chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR Tarasov M.P., academician of VASKHNIL Ushakov E.I., Rear Admiral Chaly V.F., film director Chukhrai G.N., Ambassador of the People's Republic of Albania to the USSR Nesty Nase, more than 70 famous names in total. On their initiative, the Soviet-Albanian Friendship Society was created in the USSR. Today we can fully appreciate the importance of that event and understand the significance that the friendship between our peoples had [4]. The true basis of any friendship is mutual understanding, when it is violated, relations cease to be friendly and pass into a different quality. Something similar happened between the leaders of our countries in Bucharest during the regular international inter-party conference in 1959. The background of these events is well known enough and there is no need to describe it in detail. Relations between Albania and the Soviet Union came to an end in 1961, when Moscow unilaterally withdrew its embassy from Tirana. This step of the Soviet Union led to the breakdown of all economic and political agreements concluded between Albania and the USSR, complicating the implementation of many joint projects that are very important for the Albanian economy. As you know, Albania then ended up in complete economic and political isolation. Who is right and who is wrong, let history judge.},

The study offers a complex explanation of the role of the movement during the country’s democratic transition by also looking at similar cases. Considerations of the broader international and local implications, the role of the university, the academic staff, and the student organization all are accounted for. After tracing the repertoires of strategies and content of the movement to the Albanian Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, the study argues that student activism benefitted from the structural opportunities provided by changes introduced in higher education during the historical sequence of late Socialism.},

Jahrhundert im Inneren wie von außen stark umkämpft. Adamantios Skordos rückt die damit einhergehende Bedeutung Südosteuropas für die Entwicklung des Völkerrechts im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert in den Fokus. Im Zentrum seiner interdisziplinär angelegten Studie steht zum einen die Beteiligung südosteuropäischer Völkerrechtler, Diplomaten und Politiker an transnationalen Netzwerken und internationalen Verrechtlichungsprozessen, zum anderen die wichtige Rolle, die das südosteuropäische Konfliktgeschehen in den Strategien und Diskursen international einflussreicher außerregionaler Akteure einnahm. Der Autor analysiert eingehend Studien prominenter Völkerrechtsexperten des 19. und frühen 20. Jahrhunderts wie Henry Wheaton, Johan Caspar Bluntschli, Franz von Liszt, Lassa Oppenheim, Fëdor Fëdorovič Martens, Antoine Rougier und John Westlake. Ebenso setzt er sich mit Beschlussfassungen internationaler Organisationen wie des Völkerbunds und der Vereinten Nationen und der Rechtsprechung internationaler Gerichte wie des Tribunals für das ehemalige Jugoslawien auseinander.},

  abstract = {"The second edition of the Routledge Handbook of Public Diplomacy co-edited by two leading scholars in the international relations subfield of public diplomacy, includes 16 more chapters from the first. Ten years later, a new global landscape of public diplomacy has taken shape, with major programs in graduate-level public diplomacy studies worldwide. What separates this handbook from others is its legacy and continuity from the first edition. This first edition line-up was more military-focused than this edition, a legacy to the work of Philip M. Taylor, to whom this updated edition is dedicated. This edition includes U.S. content but all case studies are outside the U.S., not only to appeal to a global audience of scholars and practitioners, but also as a way of offering something fresher than the US/UK-centric competition. In Parts 1-4, original contributors are retained, many with revised editions, but new faces emerge. Parts 5 and 6 include sixteen global case studies in public diplomacy, expanding the number of contributors by ten. The concluding part of the book includes chapters on digital and corporate public diplomacy, and a signature final chapter on the Noosphere and Noopolitik as they relate to public diplomacy. Designed for a broad audience, The Routledge Handbook of Public Diplomacy is encyclopedic in its range and depth of content, yet is written in an accessible style that will appeal to both undergraduate and postgraduate students"--},

They explore the pleasures and problems of lesbian spectatorship, both in mainstream Hollywood films including Aliens and Red Sonja, and in independent cinema from She Must be Seeing Things to Salmonberries and Desert Hearts. The authors tackle tricky questions: can a film such as Strictly Ballroom be both pleasurably camp and heterosexist? Is it ok to drool over dyke icons like Sigourney Weaver and kd lang? What makes a film lesbian, or queer, or even post-queer? What about showing sex on screen? And why do lesbian screen romances hardly ever have happy endings? Immortal, Invisible is splendidly illustrated with a selection of images from film and television texts.},

Combining film theory with a rich body of ethnographic research, Jackie Stacey investigates how female spectators understood Hollywood stars in the 1940's and 1950's. Her study challenges the universalism of psychoanalytic theories of female spectatorship which have dominated the feminist agenda within film studies for over two decades. Drawing on letters and questionnaires from over three hundred keen cinema-goers, Stacey investigates the significance of certain Hollywood stars in women's memories of wartime and postwar Britain. Three key processes of spectatorship - escapism, identification and consumption - are explored in detail in terms of their multiple and changing meanings for female spectators at this time. Star Gazing demonstrates the importance of cultural and national location for the meanings of female spectatorship, giving a new direction to questions of popular culture and female desire.},

  abstract = {In 1934, the Italian diplomat and scholar Giuseppe de Michelis (1872−1951) published a programmatic book that in English was called ‘World Reorganisation on Corporative Lines’. In this study, de Michelis suggested transferring the socio-economic model of fascist Italy to the global level. He thus envisaged global economic governance by a powerful international organisation and a strict limitation of national sovereignty over the factors of production. My purpose in this article is to explore these largely forgotten proposals as well as the ideological context from which they emerged. The fascist internationalism of de Michelis was technocratic and dirigist, enthusiastic about the possibilities of public planning and the virtues of bureaucratic organisation. This is why his suggestions resembled, in some important respects, world order proposals made by liberal internationalists during the same period. The lesson for International Relations theory is that blueprints for international institutions can be connected to a wide variety of political ideologies. There is no reason to believe that any tradition of political thought is necessarily and eternally committed to internationalism, while others are principally hostile to it.},

By assuming a wide definition of religion, it raises questions about the terms religion and religious themselves.Read together, the contents of Que(e)rying Religion provide access to a broad selection of work at the intersection of religious studies and lesbian/gay/queer studies.},

  abstract = {On the occasion of its fiftieth anniversary, the most important moment in LGBTQ history—depicted by the people who influenced, recorded, and reacted to it. June 28, 1969, Greenwich Village: The New York City Police Department, fueled by bigoted liquor licensing practices and an omnipresent backdrop of homophobia and transphobia, raided the Stonewall Inn, a neighborhood gay bar, in the middle of the night. The raid was met with a series of responses that would go down in history as the most galvanizing period in this country's fight for sexual and gender liberation: a riotous reaction from the bar's patrons and surrounding community, followed by six days of protests. Across 200 documents, Marc Stein presents a unique record of the lessons and legacies of Stonewall. Drawing from sources that include mainstream, alternative, and LGBTQ media, gay-bar guide listings, state court decisions, political fliers, first-person accounts, song lyrics, and photographs, Stein paints an indelible portrait of this pivotal moment in the LGBT movement. In The Stonewall Riots, Stein does not construct a neatly quilted, streamlined narrative of Greenwich Village, its people, and its protests; instead, he allows multiple truths to find their voices and speak to one another, much like the conversations you'd expect to overhear in your neighborhood bar. Published on the fiftieth anniversary of the moment the first brick (or shot glass?) was thrown, The Stonewall Riots allows readers to take stock of how LGBTQ life has changed in the US, and how it has stayed the same. It offers campy stories of queer resistance, courageous accounts of movements and protests, powerful narratives of police repression, and lesser-known stories otherwise buried in the historical record, from an account of ball culture in the mid-sixties to a letter by Black Panther Huey P. Newton addressed to his brothers and sisters in the resistance. For anyone committed to political activism and social justice, The Stonewall Riots provides a much-needed resource for renewal and empowerment.},

They appear at the start, dropping the painter Marianne (Noémie Merlant) off on a windswept Breton beach near the isolated home of unhappily betrothed noblewoman Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), and they reappear at the end, as the film and its characters rejoin wider society. In between, there’s a gasp of utopia.},

  abstract = {Céline Sciamma’s film Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Portrait de la jeune fille en feu, 2019) tells its 18th-century story of love and loss in part by retelling an ancient story, the myth of the poet Orpheus and his beloved Eurydice, as related by the Roman poet Ovid in his epic Metamorphoses (c. 8 CE). The myth’s most iconic moment, when Orpheus turns around to look at Eurydice and therefore loses her to Hades, occupies a central position in the film’s plot and underlies its running theme of ‘looking at’ as ‘looking back.’ By changing certain aspects of the myth – replacing poetry or singing with painting, making both main characters women, and having them alternate between the two main mythic roles – Portrait does not so much update the ancient story as debate its meanings. What does it mean to lose someone beloved but gain their image? How is every loss a kind of death, and in its train, the life that remains a kind of afterlife? Most generally, what are the links among lived experience, memory, and art? By raising these questions via the ancient myth, Portrait meditates on the effect of making, as Orpheus did, “not the lover’s choice, but the poet’s.” , Dans son film Portrait de la jeune fille en feu (2019), Céline Sciamma raconte une histoire d’amour et de séparation au xviiie siècle en reprenant en partie un récit antique, le mythe du poète Orphée et de sa bien-aimée Eurydice, tel que raconté par le poète romain Ovide dans ses Métamorphoses (v. 8 ap. J.-C.). Le moment le plus emblématique du mythe, lorsqu’Orphée se retourne pour regarder Eurydice et la perd donc au profit de l’Hadès, occupe une place centrale dans l’intrigue du film et sous-tend un thème récurrent: « regarder » [looking at] ou « regarder en arrière » [looking back]. En modifiant certains aspects du mythe – la peinture remplace la poésie ou le chant, les personnages principaux sont des femmes, qui jouent alternativement les deux principaux rôles mythiques –, Portrait n’actualise pas tant le récit antique que le débat sur ses significations. Que cela signifie-t-il de perdre un être cher mais de gagner son image ? En quoi chaque séparation est-elle une sorte de mort, et dans son sillage, la vie qui reste une sorte de vie après la mort ? Plus généralement, quels sont les liens entre l’expérience vécue, la mémoire et l’art ? En soulevant ces questions par le biais du mythe, Portrait médite sur les conséquences de faire, comme Orphée, « non pas le choix de l’amant, mais celui du poète ».Cet article a fait l’objet d’une traduction en français sur le carnet Antiquipop: https://antiquipop.hypotheses.org/8793},

Those monumental years were marked not only by violence, mass killing, and the brutal upturning of a peasant society but also by the modernization and industrialization of the largest country in the world, the victory over fascism, and the slow recovery of society after the nightmare of Stalinism. Ronald Grigor Suny is one of the most prominent experts on the revolution, the fate of the non-Russian peoples of the Soviet empire, and the twists and turns of Western historiography of the Soviet experience. As a biographer of Stalin and a long-time commentator on Russian and Soviet affairs, he brings novel insights to a history that has been misunderstood and deliberately distorted in the public sphere.

Esta escisión maoista del PCE encontrará su referente revolucionario en la República Popular Socialista de Albania. La fraternal relación reflejará la mutua dependencia entre un partido occidental que precisa de un modelo alternativo al «revisionismo» soviético, así como de un Estado que necesita presentar apoyos revolucionarios externos para justificar su aislamiento a la población. Asimismo, las estrechas relaciones sufrirán los cambios políticos de los ochenta, tanto a nivel internacional como español. The following article develops an analysis of the Spanish revolutionary left-wing movement appeared during the 60s and 70s through the vital path of Partido Comunista de España (PCE-Spanish Communist Party). This Maoist section of PCE will find its revolutionary referent on the People's Republic of Albania. This fraternal relation will show mutual reliance. On one hand, one may find a western party that needs an alternative model to Soviet revisionism; and, on the other one, a state that needs showing external revolutionary support towards its people in order to justify isolation. Nevertheless, these close relations will undergo the political changes of the 80s both at international and national level.]}

The contributors debate the practice of lesbian and queer film-making, from the queer cinema of Monika Treut to the work of lesbian film-makers Andrea Weiss and Greta Schiller. They explore the pleasures and problems of lesbian spectatorship, both in mainstream Hollywood films including Aliens and Red Sonja, and in independent cinema from She Must be Seeing Things to Salmonberries and Desert Hearts. The authors tackle tricky questions: can a film such as Strictly Ballroom be both pleasurably camp and heterosexist? Is it ok to drool over dyke icons like Sigourney Weaver and kd lang? What makes a film lesbian, or queer, or even post-queer? What about showing sex on screen? And why do lesbian screen romances hardly ever have happy endings? Immortal, Invisible is splendidly illustrated with a selection of images from film and television texts.},

  abstract = {"Maria Todorova's book is devoted to the 'golden age' of the socialist idea, broadly surveying the period in and around the time of the Second International. It critically examines the promise for an alternative socialist utopia from 1870 to the 1920s. Todorova brings in the experience of the periphery in a comparative context in the belief that the margins can often elucidate better the character of a phenomenon, and de-provincialize it from essentialist notions. In doing so, The Lost World of Socialists at Europe's Margins moves beyond the traditional historiographical emphasis on ideology by looking at different intersections or entanglements of spaces, generations, genders, ideas and feelings, and different flows of historical time. The study provides a social and cultural history of early socialism in Eastern Europe with an emphasis on Bulgaria, arguably the country with the earliest and strongest socialist movement in Southeast Europe, and one that had a unique relationship to both German and Russian social democracy. Based on a rich prosopographical database of around 3500 biographies of people born in the 19th century, the book addresses the interplay of several generations of leftists, looking at the specifics of how ideas were generated, received, transferred and transformed. Finally, the work investigates the intersection between subjectivity and memory as reflected in a unique cache of archival materials containing over 4000 documentary sources including diaries, oral interviews, and unpublished memoirs. A microhistorical approach to this material allows the reconstruction of 'structures of feeling' that inspired an exceptional group of individuals"--},

In this book twenty-two original critical essays tackle this overarching question in a series of case studies moving chronologically across the history of photography from the 1840s to the twenty-first century. The contributors explore the intersections of photography with history, memory, autobiography, time, death, mapping, the discourse of Orientalism, digital technology, and representations of race and gender. The essays range in focus from the role of photographic images in the memorialization of the Holocaust, the Argentine "Dirty Warm," and Japanese American internment camps through Man Ray's classic image "Noire et blanche" and Nan Goldin's "The Ballad of Sexual Dependency" to the function of family albums in nineteenth-century England and America.},

  abstract = {This paper reconstructs the emergence and function of the genre history of education' by comparing France and Germany in the second half of the nineteenth century. This comparison shows how particularly textbooks in this genre were written specifically for teacher education for the moral instruction of teachers, moral having a political, e.g., national, connotation. This national historiographic model was first developed in Germany, and it depicted a linear progress of humanity (also) through education and fulfillment in the nation. It crossed the national border to France after 1871, whereupon the actors were replaced with exponents of France's own history of education and the Lutheran idea of progress was replaced with a rationalistic, respectively secularized Calvinistic, idea. At the end I discuss the conditions of entitlement of the genre history of education' upon the background of increasing internationalization of the academic discussion. (DIPF/Orig.)},

The survey, it should be added, has assumed a broad interpretation of governing structures to include those structures specifically devoted, in the countries and higher education institutions and systems concerned, to strategic planning and management, to the funding of higher education and to financial management, and to quality assurance. The volume is structured into two parts. 1. The report: From words to action - changing higher education governance and management structures and functioning. - 2.

How did these publications regard their status and function within the larger information ecosystem of the People's Republic, and what is their role in the history of the modern Chinese public sphere? This article focuses on a particular subset of Red Guard papers, namely those published by radical groups within the PRC's press and publication system. These newspapers critiqued the pre-Cultural Revolution press and reflected upon the possible futures of a new, revolutionary Chinese press. Short-lived as these experiments were, they constitute a test case to re-examine the functioning of the public in a decidedly “uncivil” polity. Ultimately, they point to the ambiguous potential of the public for both consensus and conflict, liberation and repression, which characterizes the press in 20th-century China.                        ,              摘要             文化大革命时期的群众组织报刊，数量庞大，但较少获得研究界注目。文革初期，大多官办报刊陆续停刊，随而代之却有所谓“红卫兵报”崛起，中国大陆的公共领域因而发生了重大变动。文革“小报”在中国报刊史的位置是什么，跟“大报”与其它大众传媒的关系如何，内在运行与自我理解怎样？本文以文革“小报”较特殊的一种——传媒单位内部造反派所发行之小报——为中心，探讨文革“小报”的历史、作用、发刊思想等问题。作者认为，小报一面进行激烈的派别斗争，成为不同群众组织的喉舌，一面则利用文革初期宣传部门的瓦解与瘫痪状态，挑战固有的新闻宣传结构，提出草根基础、自下而上的报刊管理办法等思想，重新思考中国传媒的作用与意义。},

  abstract = {Looks can be deceiving, and in a society where one's status and access to opportunity are largely attendant on physical appearance, the issue of how difference is constructed and interpreted, embraced or effaced, is of tremendous import. Lisa Walker examines this issue with a focus on the questions of what it means to look like a lesbian, and what it means to be a lesbian but not to look like one. She analyzes the historical production of the lesbian body as marked, and studies how lesbians have used the frequent analogy between racial difference and sexual orientation to craft, emphasize, or deny physical difference. In particular, she explores the implications of a predominantly visible model of sexual identity for the feminine lesbian, who is both marked and unmarked, desired and disavowed. Walker's textual analysis cuts across a variety of genres, including modernist fiction such as The Well of Loneliness and Wide Sargasso Sea, pulp fiction of the Harlem Renaissance, the 1950s and the 1960s, post-modern literature as Michelle Cliff's Abeng, and queer theory. In the book's final chapter, "How to Recognize a Lesbian," Walker argues that strategies of visibility are at times deconstructed, at times reinscribed within contemporary lesbian-feminist theory.},

Did the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) play a crucial role in bringing the East-West conflict to an end? Or was it largely irrelevant with the implosion of the Soviet Union that decided the outcome? There is no doubt that Communism collapsed under the weight of its economic inefficiency and the rejection of its repressive political system by its subject peoples. A non-violent ending of the Cold War, however, was not preordained. Developments set in motion by the Helsinki Final Act helped make it possible. By 1989, the CSCE had supplied a normative framework conducive to the peaceful demise of Communism while providing for the radical, but orderly, disarmament that defused military confrontation in Europe. The Helsinki process created the external conditions for the internal legitimization of democratic reform movements in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.1},

The collaboration brings together preoccupations from Haynes's oeuvre and themes from Highsmith's that question reception of the film in terms of a happy ending and future progress. Through evocative art direction, camerawork, and star performances, the film invites the viewer to share the perspective of Therese (Rooney Mara), a nearly blank character written as Highsmith's stand-in, who is subsumed by desire for Carol (Cate Blanchett), a wealthy, discontented suburban wife and mother whom she meets by chance. The lovers’ exclusivity, and even their persecution, are understood as elements of fantasy that ultimately shed light on queer history.},

  abstract = {In her pioneering book Hard Core, Linda Williams put moving-image pornography on the map of contemporary scholarship with her analysis of the most popular and enduring of all film and video genres. Now, fifteen years later, she showcases the next generation of critical thinking about pornography and signals new directions for study and teaching. Porn Studies resists the tendency to situate pornography as the outer limit of what can be studied and discussed. With revenues totaling between ten and fourteen billion dollars annually—more than the combined revenues of professional football, basketball, and baseball—visual, hard-core pornography is a central feature of American popular culture. It is time, Williams contends, for scholars to recognize this and give pornography a serious and extended analysis.The essays in this volume move beyond feminist debates and distinctions between a “good” erotica and a “bad” hard core. Contributors examine varieties of pornography from the tradition of the soft-core pin-up through the contemporary hard-core tradition of straight, gay, and lesbian videos and dvds to the burgeoning phenomenon of pornography on the Internet. They explore, as examples of the genre, individual works as divergent as The Starr Report, the pirated Tommy Lee/Pamela Anderson honeymoon video, and explicit Japanese “ladies' comics” consumed by women. They also probe difficult issues such as the sexualization of race and class and the relationship of pornography to the avant-garde. To take pornography seriously as an object of analysis also means teaching it. Porn Studies thus includes a useful annotated bibliography of readings and archival sources important to the study of pornography as a cultural form.Contributors.

  abstract = {The figure of a woman reclining, in repose, displayed, abandoned, fallen, asleep, or dreaming, returns in the work of women filmmakers and photographers in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Filmmakers Agnès Varda and Catherine Breillat, and American photographer working in Paris, Nan Goldin, return to the paintings of Titian, Velázquez, Goya, Courbet, and others, re-imagining, and re-purposing, their images of female beauty, display, (auto)eroticism, and intimacy. This book, a sensuous evocation of these feminist works, claims a female-identified pleasure in looking. The artists explored align images of repose and sensuality with other images of horizontality and proneness, of strong emotional content, images of erotic involvement, of vulnerability, of bodily contortion, of listlessness, grief, and depression. The reclining nude is for all three artists a starting point for a reflection on the relation of film, projections, and still photography, to painting, and a sustained re-imagining of the meanings conjured through serial returns to a particular pose. This book claims that the image of the reclining nude is compelling, for female-identified artists - and for all allied in feeling and picturing femininity - in the sensitive, ethically adventurous, politically complex feminist issues it engages. The reclining nude is an image of passivity, of submission, of hedonism. It allows thought about passivity as pleasure, about depression and grief figured posturally, about indolence as a form of resistance and anarchy. Through this image, female-identified artists have claimed freedom to offer new focus on these extremes of emotion. They are re-imagining horizontality.},

They explore the pleasures and problems of lesbian spectatorship, both in mainstream Hollywood films including Aliens and Red Sonja, and in independent cinema from She Must be Seeing Things to Salmonberries and Desert Hearts. The authors tackle tricky questions: can a film such as Strictly Ballroom be both pleasurably camp and heterosexist? Is it ok to drool over dyke icons like Sigourney Weaver and kd lang? What makes a film lesbian, or queer, or even post-queer? What about showing sex on screen? And why do lesbian screen romances hardly ever have happy endings? Immortal, Invisible is splendidly illustrated with a selection of images from film and television texts.},

  abstract = {Open peer review (OPR), where review reports and reviewers’ identities are published alongside the articles, represents one of the last aspects of the open science movement to be widely embraced, although its adoption has been growing since the turn of the century. This study provides the first comprehensive investigation of OPR adoption, its early adopters and the implementation approaches used. Current bibliographic databases do not systematically index OPR journals, nor do the OPR journals clearly state their policies on open identities and open reports. Using various methods, we identified 617 OPR journals that published at least one article with open identities or open reports as of 2019 and analyzed their wide-ranging implementations to derive emerging OPR practices. The findings suggest that: (1) there has been a steady growth in OPR adoption since 2001, when 38 journals initially adopted OPR, with more rapid growth since 2017; (2) OPR adoption is most prevalent in medical and scientific disciplines (79.9\%); (3) five publishers are responsible for 81\% of the identified OPR journals; (4) early adopter publishers have implemented OPR in different ways, resulting in different levels of transparency. Across the variations in OPR implementations, two important factors define the degree of transparency: open identities and open reports. Open identities may include reviewer names and affiliation as well as credentials; open reports may include timestamped review histories consisting of referee reports and author rebuttals or a letter from the editor integrating reviewers’ comments. When and where open reports can be accessed are also important factors indicating the OPR transparency level. Publishers of optional OPR journals should add metric data in their annual status reports.},

  abstract = {"A reflection on "freedom" in a dramatic, beautifully written memoir of the end of Communism in the Balkans. Lea Ypi grew up in the last Stalinist country in Europe: Albania, a place of queuing and scarcity, of political executions and secret police. While family members disappeared to what she was told were "universities" from which few "graduated", she swore loyalty to the Party. In her eyes, people were equal, neighbors helped each other, and children were expected to build a better world. Then the statues of Stalin and Hoxha were toppled. Almost overnight, people could vote and worship freely and invest in hopes of striking it rich. But factories shut, jobs disappeared and thousands fled to Italy, only to be sent back. Pyramid schemes bankrupted the country, leading to violence. One generation's dreams became another's disillusionment. As her own family's secrets were revealed, Lea found herself questioning what "freedom" really means.

From a historical point of view, this is related with the process of national state building and as a consequence the study of folklore is instrumental zed and improved from the communist power to build its own strategy. Folkloric studies and traditional music especially, were taught in schools and universities as part of national culture. The way how are perceived and constructed these books emphasizes the idea of folklore as an ideological and political structure. We could say that the lessons of traditional music have influenced the culture of masses that was developed after the fall of communism. This article studies the period of communism when knowledge on folklore was instrumental zed in favor of the national state building.},
